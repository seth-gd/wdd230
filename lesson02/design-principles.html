            <p class="desc">Elements related to each other are closer to each other than any other element in the screen. For example, the buttons for "Sign Up" and "Log In" are close to each other since both buttons are related to the user's account. The play buttons are also close to each other because both buttons are about starting a game, online or with a computer. There are more examples of proximity all throughout the page.</p>

            <p class="desc">In a mobile view, at the top of the page, elements are either aligned to the left or right. This is the navigation. Down from there, everything on the screen, like the heading, the text, and the image, is aligned to the center in a vertical line. Almost everything on the page is center aligned with a few exceptions that follow different alignment.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="desc">The page presents three choices in a mobile view: 1) open the navigation, 2) download Godot, and 3) scroll down to see the rest of the website content. The user is not overwhelmed with decisions. In desktop view, there are more decisions to make when the user first enters the page. The decision time is not severely affected as the download button is easy to spot, and the navigation isn't flooded with too many options.</p>
